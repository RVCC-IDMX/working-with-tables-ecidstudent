    <td class="tg-0pky">A song I'm slightly less fond of than the others, it's good but I enjoy the rest more.<br>To go with the almost hauntingly melodic tone it carries, the message to go with them<br>is just as important. Love yourself, no matter what anyone else may say, love yourself.<br>A message I believe to be very important.</td>
