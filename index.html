Phantom by Natewantstobattle                                                    & May 4th, 2018     & USA               & 10/10  & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}A song that I always find myself coming back to, even almost 5 years later, \\ this is one I can definitely, heavily recommend listening to.\end{tabular}                                                                                                                                                                         \\

Love yourself, no matter what anyone else may say, love yourself.\\ A message I believe to be very important.\end{tabular} \\
